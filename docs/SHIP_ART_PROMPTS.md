## Hotspot Configuration

Once `station.png` is finalized, adjust these coordinates to match the actual sector positions:

```typescript
// src/hotspots.ts
export interface Hotspot {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  bounds: { x: number; y: number; w: number; h: number };
}

// Coordinates as percentage of image (0-1 range)
export const HOTSPOTS: Hotspot[] = [
  { id: 'bridge',  label: 'Bridge',       bounds: { x: 0.40, y: 0.05, w: 0.20, h: 0.25 } },
  { id: 'comms',   label: 'Comms Deck',   bounds: { x: 0.70, y: 0.20, w: 0.25, h: 0.20 } },
